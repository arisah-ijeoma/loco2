Hello, welcome to the software engineering Loco2 programming challenge!

This task involves using test-driven development to write some Ruby code of
your own. The README file in the task directory explains the details.

There's no time limit for completing this task. We would expect it to
take a few hours, but we understand that everyone works at their own pace,
so there's no strict deadline. We don't want to be unreasonable and want
to be respectful of your time - so you are not expected to stay up all
night coding away! As with a real project, you may want to take breaks and
your git commits will reflect this. Don't worry, you won't be marked
down for taking breaks.

As you work on your solution, you should make commits to the repository
along the way, just as you would on a real project. This is so we can
see the progression and identify how you came to the solutions you did.

This folder already contains an empty git repository. It has been
initialised to conceal your name and email when you make commits -
please don't change this. Your submission will be assessed
independently of the covering letter / CV you have already sent.

Have fun, and feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear.
