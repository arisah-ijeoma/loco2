In the `search.xml` file is some XML output from a hypothetical rail
search API. The scenario is that we have performed a search from London
to Barcelona, and this is the output which we need to parse and display.

Unfortunately the real rail APIs are nowhere near this simple, but this
example provides more than enough complexity for the challenge!

Some definitions:

* There are 3 *search results*, representing different options for
  making the journey

* A search result has one or more *connections*, representing the
  individual train rides which make up the whole journey

* A *fare* represents the cost of travelling on this train in a given
  class of service (standard class, first class, etc). The currency is
  indicated in the XML, but it's always GBP (British Pounds) in our example.
  Please note that the decimal point (`.`) separates pence/cents from pounds,
  so `25.50` means 25 pounds and 50 pence.

## Your task ##

Your task is to write a program which will parse the XML file and output
information gleaned from the data.

The output should contain the following information for each search
result:

* ID of search result
  time/train name)
* Description of each connection, including start/finish and departure/arrival times and train names. Note: Times should be in the timezone local to the station
* Duration of each connection (represented as hours and minutes)
* How many train changes need to be made
* How much time the passenger has for each train change
* Duration of the whole journey (represented as hours and minutes)
* Fare names / prices for each connection
* The cheapest search result
* The quickest search result

## What we're looking for ##

Below is a scoring rubric that outlines the five areas for which
you will be marked. If you run out of time that's fine, but we urge you to
concentrate your time on these areas and don't get caught up handling
edge-cases and performance optimisations.

You can assume that program will only ever need to handle the XML input
provided and you don't need to implement error handling.

The formatting of the output of the program is also unimportant, so don't
spend much time on this. There's no need to make it into a web app or
anything - a console program with text output is fine.

However, whilst we don't expect you to implement this, you might want to
consider how open the program is to handling additional types of output
with different formatting.

You are expected to write tests to guide your development, and make
regular commits to the repository so that we can see the progression of
how it developed. We don't expect the tests to provide 100% code coverage.

You may use whichever gems, testing framework or tools you are comfortable with.
